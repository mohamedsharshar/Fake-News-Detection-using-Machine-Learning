Data Description
submission.csv: This file contains two columns:
ID: Unique identifier for each news article.
TARGET: Predicted label (1 for fake news, 0 for real news).
Project Workflow
Import Modules
The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Load Data
The dataset is loaded and basic exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.

Data Preprocessing
This section covers cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming text data into features suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training
Various machine learning models are trained on the processed data, and their performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

Submission
The predictions on the test set are saved in submission.csv.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are used to interpret the model's results.
Notes
Ensure to review and run each cell in the notebook sequentially.
The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each step of the process.
Future Improvements
Experiment with different feature extraction techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).
Try advanced models like deep learning or ensemble methods.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
